Wayland Build Tools
-------------------

These are scripts that automate the standard Wayland build and installation
directions (http://wayland.freedesktop.org/building.html), and take care of
downloading and building the various upstream components needed for Wayland,
the Weston compositor, and Xwayland.

These scripts and instructions are tested with a fresh installation of Ubuntu,
and should work well for any Debian-based distro that uses APT.


Step 1: Install git, and clone the wayland-build-tools repository

        apt-get install -y git
        git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-build-tools

Where you place this repository is up to you.


Step 2: Prepare expected directories

        mkdir ~/Wayland # sources and builds will be here
        mkdir -p ~/.config/wayland-build-tools
        cp wl_defines.sh ~/.config/wayland-build-tools/

You can change these directories if you wish, but these are the defaults
and you'll need to edit the scripts to match. See WL_ROOT and WLD in
wl_defines.sh.


Step 3: Install packaged build dependencies

        ./wl_install_deps


Step 4: Clone the necessary repositories

        ./wl_clone


Step 5: Build upstream dependencies, Wayland, and Weston

        ./wl_build


Step 6: Run Weston

        source ~/.config/wayland-build-tools/wl_defines.sh
        weston

Build scripts and configuration for other distros are welcome. For more
details, see https://blogs.s-osg.org/kick-waylands-tires-wayland-build-tools.


Wayland Uninstalled
-------------------

We now also include a helper script, wl_uninstalled, to build and work with an
uninstalled wayland/weston environment comprised of the following repositories:

wayland
wayland-protocols
libinput
weston

The wl_uninstalled script provides a shell environment in which all build and
run run-time dependencies are resolved in such a way that the uninstalled
versions of the above projects take precedence.

Quick instructions:

Let's use Weston as an example although other wayland-based projects should work
as well.

* Edit a local copy of the script to make $WLD point to the base directory
  where your repositories are (make sure to use the absolute paths). You can
  also set the WLD environment variable to a path of your choice and leave
  the script untouched. Then, after executing the script, issue the following
  commands to have everything built and weston running from the uninstalled
  environment.

    cd $WLD
    for i in wayland wayland-protocols libinput weston; do
    cd $i && ./autogen.sh && make && cd ..; done
    weston &
